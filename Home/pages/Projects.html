                    <h1> This Portfolio Website </h1>
                    <p> The basic idea for this project of mine was to learn new (and develop existing) skills in order to create one space that takes on lots of different layouts and designs that acts as a platform to host my work, information about myself, and responsive interactive content (such as a contact page). This took the form of a portfolio website that has four main pages: Home, About Me, Projects and Contact Me. </p>

                    <h1> Cuss Word Censoring Chrome Extension </h1>
                    <p> For this project, I had the goal of building a chrome extension that would read the words on any given webpage as it is loaded and censor any cuss words from a set list in compliance with the users censor preferences. In order to accomplish this, I had to learn and successfully implement crucial chrome extension API (such as local storage) on top of my HTML, javascript and CSS. </p>

                    <h1> Reaction Test Chrome Extension </h1>
                    <p> This project was the creation of a simple chrome extension that would act as an on-demand reaction time test for the user. It works with the straightforward implementation of a button and timer, along with some more HTML, javascript and CSS, to let the user start a reaction time test from their browser with an easy-to-use interface and accurately display their reaction time to pressing a button after it changes colour.  </p>

I chose to do this because I believe it not only helped me hone my skills in these languages but also create a website that was more unique to me and could display my skills to myself and as part of a project showcase.<br><br>Each page has a specific purpose and an easy to understand layout that gives users full control. User experience was considered at every stage and all information is displayed in a simple and logical manner for the ideal reading case. The HTML and CSS make good use of colour, responsive scale sizing and styles to bring the content on the page to the best attention of the user.<br><br>The Javascript is simple but effective in its design. Each page uses Javascript as part of its design with some specific pages relying on it more heavily. The Contact Me page has a fully working form that sends me emails directly and the projects page has an efficient searching tool that a user can easily use to help navigate through my projects. The Website is also fully mobile responsive with unique tailored page designs for mobile and desktop users.")
